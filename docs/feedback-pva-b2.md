Overall Feedback
Dear Sem,
Thank you for submitting your PvA. It is an easy-to-understand document (D2). At the same time, improvements are necessary, especially regarding the methodology used to write your paper (D3). Ensure to address it in the final article.
You can see the list below:
1. The issue or topic to be investigated is clearly described
(+) The topic of parsing PDF documents into usable text is clearly described
(-) The problem framing is descriptive. It missed the opportunity to articulate different types of downstream tasks that require the extraction of PDF documents (e.g., information extraction for storage or inference, creation of training data for classification, instruction, next word, etc.) and what the challenges are and their categories, and how they affect these tasks.
(-) The gap in terms of tutorials is debatable. These tools already have comprehensive documentation. I would build the gap based on the challenges of parsing PDFs for specific tasks.
2. The objective is achievable within the time
(+) Well-detailed set of tasks
(+) Yes, it is realistic; objectives are modest; achievability is high, but ambition is limited.
(+) Using mature and known tools, reducing the risks of issues
3. The objective is relevant to the project
(+) Yes, the objective aligns well with the project scope.
(+) Good focus on reproducibility.
(−) Looks like the strong emphasis on Dutch municipal documents isn't entirely justified. My impression is that this is a global and recurring problem, not confined to municipalities.
(-) Very unclear what the link is between preprocessing choices and actual project tasks (e.g., fine-tuning, inference, storage, retrieval)
4. The aim and scope of the paper are concise and clearly formulated
(+) The scope is clearly bounded
(-) At the same time, it is not clear which NLP downstream tasks the preprocessing is aiming to support.
(-) There is no mention or support for large-scale scenarios (e.g., very large document, batch processing, distributed, parallel processing)
(-) The scope seems too general and, at the same time, too basic.
(-) Much of the content overlaps with existing PyMuPDF documentation and others; the added value is not always clear. Please avoid duplication.
(-) The proposal does not focus on challenging or extreme cases (e.g., multi-column layouts, complex tables, format transformations such as JSON).
(-) OCR is explicitly excluded, which removes one of the most difficult and relevant ingestion challenges.
(-) The EDA component for text preprocessing remains quite basic (e.g., character count).
(-) Relatively small dataset. It is not a problem to use smaller datasets, but they should be sufficient to demonstrate the technique you aim to cover.
(!) Advice: proceed with adjustments, focus on a few specialised cases (e.g., complex tables, OCR content, complex layouts, large documents, information extraction), and make clear which downstream task you are focusing on.
5. The sources (still to be studied) are of good quality
(+) relevant references
(-) skewed too much to the tool documentation
(-) Little coverage of work that critically evaluates preprocessing quality, ingestion robustness, or downstream sensitivity
6. There is a clear definition of the target audience
(+) The target audience is well defined
(-) It is unclear to the reader which task you are covering.
Feel free to reach out in case of questions.
